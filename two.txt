Enter the four numbers of S box: 0 1 3 2

 2 bit Binary of 0 is 00
 2 bit Binary of 1 is 01
 2 bit Binary of 3 is 11
 2 bit Binary of 2 is 10

 Now we take first bit from all four 2-bit binary:---


First bit of 0 is 0
First bit of 1 is 0
First bit of 3 is 1
First bit of 2 is 1

 Now we take first bit from all four 2-bit binary:---



 Now Suppose X3= 	0	0	1	1

 Now we take second bit from all four 2-bit binary:---


Second bit of 0 is 0
Second bit of 1 is 1
Second bit of 3 is 1
Second bit of 2 is 0

 Now we take 2nd bit from all four 2-bit binary:---



 Now Suppose X4= 	0	1	1	0

Now we take the positions of the S-Box as inputs,that is ,POSITION 0,1,2,3:-----
Here too we get 2 more binary patterns of 4-bit long..that is extracting first and second bits..

 Now Suppose X1= 	0	0	1	1

 Now Suppose X2= 	0	1	0	1
